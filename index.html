      <p>
	  Early cancer diagnosis from bisulfite-treated cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments require tedious data analytical procedures. 
	  Here, we present a Deep-learning-based approach for Early Cancer Interception and DIAgnosis (DECIDIA) that can achieve 
	  accurate cancer diagnosis exclusively from bisulfite-treated cfDNA sequencing fragments. 
	  DECIDIA relies on feature representation learning of DNA fragments and weakly supervised learning for classification. 
	  DECIDIA achieved high classification performance in diagnosis of cancer and cancer-type classification without the requirement of reads mapping.
      </p>

	  <p>
      We provided DECIDIA for diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) and cancer-type prediction (i.e. colorectal cancer vs. 
	  hepatocellular carcinoma vs. lung cancer). DECIDIA expects a text input file of sequencing reads one per line. 
	  For example, you can put the following reads in a text file <b>read.txt</b> and upload the file. 
	  DECIDIA runs prediction on your local browser by using <a href="https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/">onnxruntime-web</a>. 
	  Therefore, it's safe that data never leaves the device for inferencing. 
	  It will take a few seconds to cache the model locally for the first time.
